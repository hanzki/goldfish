I decided to start this blog so that I could share my opinions and skills with anyone who might be interested in reading about them. Also I wanted to train my writing skills and have 
a platform for my possible future projects.

The name comes from lack of better ideas and the fact that I constantly forget names, dates, tasks, etc. and my girlfriend jokes often that I have a memory of a goldfish. 🐟

This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the code can be found on github at {% include icon-github.html username="hanzki" %} / [goldfish](https://github.com/hanzki/goldfish)
