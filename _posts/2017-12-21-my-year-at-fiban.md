    I spent most of 2017 doing my non-military service at Finnish Business Angels Network. 
    Everything didn't go as planned, but I learned a lot. Here's my story.
---

Most of 2017 I have been working for the [Finnish Business Angels Network ry][fiban] (FiBAN) as part of my non-military 
service. Before starting, I didn’t really know what to expect from this year and there were times when I questioned 
whether or not I had made a mistake. However, now looking back, I’m very happy with my decision and the time I spent at 
FiBAN. Here are some of my thoughts about my time there.

## Background

First, I’ll explain a bit what the non-military service means and tell a bit about the FiBAN organization as I’m aware 
you might not be familiar with either one of them.

### Non-Military Service in Finland

In Finland, we have [compulsory military service][intti] for all men between ages 18 and 30. The military service takes 6, 9, or 
11.5 months depending on the person’s role and assignment in the military. However, there is also a choice of 
completing the military service requirement by partaking in non-military service for 11.5 months. The non-military 
service consists of a month-long training period at the non-military service center and 10.5 months of full-time work 
at a governmental or a non-profit organization. However, the role of the non-military service person is not pre-defined 
or limited and can be decided by the organization and the service person to fit the skills of the service person.

### Finnish Business Angels Network ry (FiBAN)

[FiBAN][fiban] is a non-profit association consisting of over 600 investor members who are interested in investing in startups. 
These “business angels” have often a history of entrepreneurship and usually provide the startups they invest in with 
their expertise in addition to their money. FiBAN itself doesn’t make investments but focuses on connecting FiBAN’s 
members with promising startups looking for funding.

I heard about FiBAN through an acquaintance I had met while working at [Solinor][solinor]. He recommended me to contact FiBAN and 
I had the opportunity to be the first non-military serviceperson at FiBAN.

## My Time at FiBAN

A year is a long time. A lot of things can happen in a year, but looking back it feels like hardly any time has passed. 
As I was the first non-military service person at FiBAN, there were some growing pains before I could find my role in 
the organization. Here’s my story.

### Finding My Role at FiBAN

Before starting at FiBAN, I had naïvely envisioned that I could waltz in with my software developing knowledge, easily 
notice inefficient practices or overlooked needs, and solve them by building software tools and systems. However, after 
starting in February, I soon noticed that it wouldn’t be as easy as I thought (nothing ever is) as the three-person 
office, providing mainly very personal help and services, didn’t seem to need my expertise. There was also an 
understandable aversion of complex technical solutions as the office personnel wouldn’t have the required skills for 
maintenance of such systems after my departure and buying these services could be expensive.

I spent my time in the spring chasing different ideas but felt my time was partly wasted as there was a severe lack of 
commitment to and focus on any single idea. I did utilise my technical skills in updating the FiBAN website, but it 
wasn’t a pleasant experience as the pages were built on top of the [Weebly][weebly] content management system, which is quite 
horrible to use. Weebly’s editor feels extremely sluggish to use and contains many inconsistent “features” which make 
building a website a very exasperating experience.

At times I felt that I had made a mistake in choosing to do my non-military service at FiBAN as I didn’t see how I 
could properly utilize my skills and thought I would be doomed to do menial tasks for the rest of the year. However, 
eventually things did turn around and I found ways in which I could really make an impact.

### Making an Impact

The first project I created that was really adopted by FiBAN and its members was an automatic meeting room reservation 
system. It was for FiBAN’s investor members to book a meeting room from the FiBAN office without needing to bother 
our office staff.

The largest project that I undertook was a web service for [NordicBAN][nordicban] (another angel network that FiBAN participated 
in founding this year) where the investor members can find and connect with each other. The service provides user 
authentication so the information would be only available to the members of the angel network. Investors can also 
browse open investment rounds and auxiliary documents.

This summer I happened to buy a camera for my trip to China and decided to start  photographing as a hobby. 
This proved to be very useful at FiBAN as FiBAN organizes many events but only has a few good photos from the events. 
This was a need I noticed and one that I could fulfil while doing something I enjoy and improve my skills.

## What I Learned During the Year

I feel that there were many things I learned this year and got to improve myself on. Here are some that you might 
find interesting.

### Business Angels, Who Are They?

Following the activities of FiBAN, I learned a lot about how the investor side of the startup culture work. Before 
this, my contacts to the startup community had been mostly limited to attending to a couple of events organized by the 
[AaltoES][aaltoes] at our university.

I got to see what kind of people the business angels are. They are a very interesting bunch and many have a background 
in entrepreneurship. At FiBAN some call angel investing as co-entrepreneurship and I can attest that as an angel 
investor telling about his/her investment sounds like the entrepreneur telling about his/her startup.

### Startups & Pitches

I also got to see what good and bad startup pitches look like. I also learned that the pitch alone doesn’t raise an 
investor’s interest as one can make an interesting pitch about a bad idea, but a startup with a horrible pitch can have 
a good idea. The pitches I saw further showed that there are many startups trying to solve very similar problems. So, 
I would say based on seeing a single pitch or single startup it can be hard to say if it’s good or not but when you go 
through dozens it’s easier to notice the ones that stand out.

### Self-Learning

Even though in the spring I had problems finding my role in FiBAN that gave me more free time to think about my own 
future and things I want to do and achieve. This enabled me to begin writing this blog, something I had already been 
thinking of doing for some time. Similarly, I have tried to read more this year. I have managed to read Building 
Microservices by Sam Newman, Clean Code by Robert C. Martin, and I have almost finished Working Effectively with 
Legacy Code by Michael Feathers.

### Google Ecosystem
While working on the things I built for FiBAN, I learned most about using the different APIs and scripting tools 
offered by Google and G Suite. The meeting room booking system I made is constructed on top of Google Sheets, 
Google Forms, Gmail and Google Calendar. All of these different services could be tied together quite easily with 
the use of [Google Apps Script][gas].

## Conclusion
I’m very happy for choosing non-military service over the military service. Even though it could have been fun 
running in the forest playing war, I much rather work in a clean office in the middle of Helsinki and sleep nights 
at home in my own bed.

I profusely enjoyed my time at FiBAN. During the year I met and got to know many very talented and hard-working 
people. I feel I could really bring value to FiBAN but also improve my skills and myself over the year.

Thank you to everyone who helped to make this year awesome. You are awesome!
