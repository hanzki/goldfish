    Story of my first time attending Disobey, the annual celebration of hacker culture in the heart of Helsinki.
    The event was great and I'll surely return next year.

Last weekend I attended the [Disobey][disobey] hacker conference in Helsinki. This was my first time attending an event of this 
kind and I was very pleased with the content and the atmosphere of the conference. Now, I want to share my experience 
with you.

## Inspiration

Even though the first Disobey conference was held 2016 I hadn’t heard about it before 2017 when a friend of mine 
recommended it to me. I was aware of [DEF CON][defcon] and [Black Hat][blackhat] which are some of the world’s largest hacker conferences and 
I had seen some very interesting talks from them on youtube. I saw Disobey as a unique opportunity to attend such an 
event, meet interesting people and learn new things. After all as a software developer who wants to build secure 
systems you have to learn about all the ways people are using to attack the systems we build.

> [The Art of Trolling][yt-trolling]  
> [Genetic Diseases to Guide Digital Hacks of the Human Genome][yt-genetics]  
> [Lessons from Surviving a 300Gbps Denial of Service Attack][yt-ddos]

## Preliminary puzzle

Disobey has a tradition of publishing [a puzzle][disobey-puzzle] before the event which requires various technical skills to solve. As a 
prize for solving the puzzle, they offer an opportunity to buy a discounted and limited HACKER class tickets. I found 
the puzzle fun and interesting and managed to solve it with some help from my friend. The puzzle consisted of a PNG 
image with hidden information followed by the second stage with a mysterious audio file leading to the final stage 
where the task was to find the solution by decompiling a binary executable file. With my ticket to the party secured I 
just had to wait until January.

## Better safe than sorry

If you are planning to spend your weekend surrounded by hackers it might be a good idea to rethink about the digital 
devices you carry with you daily. I’ve heard that in the bigger conferences across the pond it is recommended to leave 
your personal devices home unless you want to be a walking target.

I decided to dust off my 7 years old ThinkPad x201 and install a fresh installation of [Kali Linux][kalilinux]. I chose Kali as my 
Linux flavour of choice as I was expecting I could have a use for the many pre-installed tools that it comes with it 
even though I’m not familiar with the usage of most of them. For my mobile needs, I took my previous phone (HTC M8). 
Even though its microphone isn’t working perfectly anymore, it was good enough for the weekend. I ran the factory reset 
on the device and created a new google account in order to avoid linking the phone to any of my personal accounts or 
credentials. I even removed all contactless payment cards from my wallet just to be on the safe side.

Was all this necessary? Probably not. What would have happened if I had just taken my personal laptop and phone? 
Probably nothing remarkable. Was it fun to plan for the precautions and disconnect me from the usual devices and 
distractions for a weekend? Definitely! I think doing all these preparations was a kind of a ritual in itself which 
enhanced the experience I later had at the conference.

## The conference

Arriving at the Kattilahalli, the venue of the conference, I first noticed multiple signs about respecting the privacy 
of the attendees and about protecting one’s devices by forbidding photography and wireless networks. I wasn’t 
intimidated as I had done my preparations and I continued directly to the registration desk where I was handed a 
plain brown paper bag. Inside the paper bag with some stickers and the information leaflet was my conference badge. 
And oh boy what badge that was. A black PCB board covered with integrated circuits, L.E.D.s, buttons and interesting 
markings. Also worth a mention was the absence of my name on the badge.

### Talks

Inside the venue was a big stage for the various presentations and talks of the conference. On the stage, there was 
something going on almost all the time. Many of the talks I listened to were very interesting. A couple that pop into 
my mind are a talk by F-Secure about retrieving BitLocker through a cold boot attack, a talk about the tactics utilized 
by people doing phishing, and a very good presentation about tor de-anonymization. 

Sadly as at the time of writing, these talks are not yet available anywhere. On [the Disobey youtube channel][disobey-youtube] they have 
some talks from last year and they did record all the presentations this year, so I’m sure they will release at least 
some of them at some point in the future.

### Workshops

They also had a side room for more hands-on workshops. Some of the workshops seemed quite interesting, but I didn’t 
manage to attend any of them as I often missed the starting time and I found it hard to join the workshop in the middle. 
Next year I will aim to attend some of the workshops in order to get more hands-on experience.

### Challenges

During the conference, there were also two open hacker challenges for people to compete to solve. One was the Capture 
The Flag challenge which comprised of different kinds of challenges in the local Disobey network. The other challenge 
was to discover the mysteries behind the conference badge.

My friends and I decided not to use time on the network challenges but tried to have a closer look at the badge. We 
didn’t get too far, but found out that by pressing the buttons on the badge in the right order and then touching two 
badges together you could get more lights to light up on your badge.

Solving the challenges with a group of friends would probably have been quite fun but we thought that there were more 
interesting things to do at the conference than fiddling with our computers trying to crack the nuts.

### Lock Picking

At the Disobey there was also an opportunity to get more physical amidst of all the computer stuff. I was familiar with 
the principal how lockpicking works but I had never before gotten a chance to try picking a real lock. I have to say 
the experience was quite interesting. It’s quite hard to get the feeling about what’s happening inside the keyway and 
it’s hard to judge whether you are applying too little or too much force on the tension wrench and the lockpick. Even 
though it can be frustrating to try and fail to get the lock open, the activity is oddly calming. I’m thinking of 
buying a set of picks for meditation.

## Summary

I greatly enjoyed my time at Disobey and I’ll be sure to attend also next year. The conference had a very nice atmosphere 
and there were many interesting things to do and learn. Next time I’ll probably have a stab at the challenges and I’ll 
aim to attend more of the workshops. I want to thank Disobey for organizing such an awesome conference and Reaktor for 
delicious G&Ts offered at their lounge as well for a nice after party at their office afterwards.
